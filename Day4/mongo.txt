* What are NoSQL Databases?

    A NoSQL database has dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, 
    column-oriented, graph-based or organized as a KeyValue store. This flexibility means that documents can be created without having 
    defined structure first. Also each document can have its own unique structure. The syntax varies from database to database, and you 
    can add fields as you go. 

 *SQL vs NoSQL Databases

    SQL Databases
    -These databases have fixed or static or predefined schema     
    -These databases are not suited for hierarchical data storage.
    -These databases are best suited for complex queries
    -Vertically Scalable
    - Follows ACID properties

    NoSQL Databases 
        -They have dynamic schema 
        -These databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage.
        -These databases are not so good for complex queries
        - Horizontally Scalable
        - Follows BASE(Basically Avaialable Soft state Eventually consistent)
        - Follows CAP(consistency, availability, partition tolerance)
